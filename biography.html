              <p>
                James Mayhew is a promising young pianist currently in his first
                year at the prestigious Royal Academy of Music, where he studies
                under the tutelage of the renowned pianist Ian Fountain. His
                musical journey has been marked by dedication, exceptional
                talent, and a deep passion for both performance and composition.
              </p>

              <p>
                For four formative years, James honed his craft at Wells
                Cathedral School under the expert guidance of Hilary Coates and
                Joseph Tong. His time there culminated in reaching the finals of
                the school's highly competitive concerto competition, where he
                delivered a stunning performance of the first movement of
                Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 – one of the most demanding
                and beloved works in the piano repertoire.
              </p>

              <p>
                James's competitive spirit and musical excellence were further
                demonstrated when he secured second place at the Oxford Piano
                Competition for Aspiring Professionals, competing against
                talented pianists from across the country. This achievement
                underscores his technical proficiency and interpretive maturity
                as a performer.
              </p>

              <p>
                Beyond his role as a performer, James has established himself as
                a composer of considerable promise. He has showcased his
                original compositions in numerous performances, with his
                Fugue-Fantasy standing as a particularly notable work that
                demonstrates his understanding of both traditional forms and
                contemporary musical language.
              </p>

              <p>
                What sets James apart is his adventurous approach to repertoire.
                He actively seeks out and explores lesser-known works,
                particularly those by composers such as Charles-Valentin Alkan
                and Samuil Feinberg – composers renowned for creating music of
                extraordinary technical and interpretive difficulty. This
                dedication to expanding the boundaries of standard repertoire
                speaks to his commitment to musical exploration and his fearless
                approach to challenging material.
              </p>

              <p>
                Collaboration lies at the heart of James's musical philosophy.
                He actively seeks opportunities to work with other musicians,
                understanding that the exchange of ideas and the sharing of
                musical experiences enriches both his own artistry and that of
                his collaborators. This collaborative spirit has led to numerous
                chamber music performances and continues to be a driving force
                in his musical development.
              </p>

              <p>
                As James continues his studies at the Royal Academy of Music,
                audiences can look forward to witnessing the continued evolution
                of an artist who combines technical excellence with genuine
                musical curiosity, promising performances that are both
                technically accomplished and deeply moving.
